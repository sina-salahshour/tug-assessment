# Nextjs Boilerplate

This is a `Node22` and [Nextjs 15](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/deprecated-main/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you don't have the `pnpm` installed already, install it with the following commands:

```bash
# using corepack:
corepack enable

# or using npm
pnpm i --global pnpm@10.9.0
```

then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

You can run the following commands in the project scope:

```bash

# run the development server
pnpm dev

# build the project
pnpm build

# preview the build result
pnpm start
```

For the dev server, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Using version manager

You can run the command `fnm use` (or `nvm use`) for switching to the correct node version.
